# Phase 2.2 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 2.2 "Universe UI" has been successfully completed. This phase enhanced the Universe Management system with a comprehensive user interface including details display, recent history tracking, and settings configuration.

## Completed Tasks

### ✓ Universe Details Panel
**File:** `src/worldbuilder/views/universe_details_panel.py`

- Created a comprehensive details panel widget that displays:
  - Basic Information (Name, Author, Genre, Status)
  - Full Description with rich text support
  - Metadata (ID, Created Date, Updated Date)
- Organized information into logical groups using QGroupBox
- Displays empty state when no universe is selected
- All text is selectable for easy copying
- Responsive layout with scroll support for long content

### ✓ Recent Universes List
**File:** `src/worldbuilder/views/recent_universes_widget.py`

- Implemented a recent universes tracking widget with:
  - Persistent storage using JSON (saved to `~/.worldbuilder/recent.json`)
  - Maximum of 10 recent universes (configurable via MAX_RECENT constant)
  - Most recently opened universes appear first
  - Double-click to quickly open a recent universe
  - Tooltips showing author and genre information
  - "Clear History" button to reset the list
  - Automatic validation (removes deleted universes from history)
- Integrates with main window to track universe opens

### ✓ Universe Settings Page
**File:** `src/worldbuilder/views/universe_settings_dialog.py`

- Created a comprehensive settings dialog with organized groups:
  
  **Calendar System:**
  - Calendar type selection (Gregorian, Custom, None)
  - Days per week configuration (1-20)
  - Months per year configuration (1-30)
  - Days per year configuration (1-1000)
  
  **Timeline Settings:**
  - Timeline unit selection (Standard Years, Custom Era, Before/After Event)

  **Data Management:**
  - Automatic backup toggle
  - Backup frequency configuration (1-30 days)
  - Dynamic enable/disable of backup frequency based on toggle
  
- Note: Settings are configured in UI but persistence will be implemented in future phases

- Added imports for new widgets
- Integrated details panel with 2:1 splitter layout
- Added recent universes widget at the top of the interface
- Connected universe selection signal to update details panel
- Added "Universe Settings" menu item (Ctrl+Shift+S)

- Universe details panel display logic
- Settings dialog creation and data retrieval

**Test Results:** ✓ All tests passing

### Existing Tests
- All Phase 1 and Phase 2.1 tests continue to pass
- No regressions introduced

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Better Information Visibility:** Users can now see detailed universe information without opening dialogs
2. **Quick Access:** Recent universes widget allows fast switching between frequently used universes
3. **Future-Proofing:** Settings dialog provides foundation for future calendar and timeline features
4. **Professional Layout:** Split-panel design provides efficient use of screen space
